# Awesome-Graph-Anomaly-Detection[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
A collection of AWESOME things about **Graph Anomaly Detection**.

Graph related algorithm have shown remarkable progress in data analysis tasks. Graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing a curated list of research papers that explore the anomaly detection in graphs (node-, edge-, and graph-level).
